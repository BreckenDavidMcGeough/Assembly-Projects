# Assembly Projects From CSE341:Computer Organization

## First project: min-max algorithm

The first project is 'pA.asm', which is a MIPS assembly program that takes in an array of ints and calculates the minimum value of the array and the maximum value of the array.

## Second project: bubble-sort algorithm 

The second project is 'sort_backup.s', which is a MIPS assembly program that takes an unsorted array of ints, sorts them from least to greatest using bubble sort, then returns the sorted array.
